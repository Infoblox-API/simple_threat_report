.. important::
  Please ensure you have Python 3 plus the required modules as defined in the  :doc:`requirements` section.

Installing Python
=================

You can install the latest version of Python 3.x by downloading the appropriate installer for your system from `python.org <https://python.org>`_.

.. note::

  MacOS come with Python 2.x by default so you will need to install Python 3 as above or if via Homebrew, Ports, etc.

.. note::

  If you are installing Python on Windows, be sure to check the box to have Python added to your PATH if the installer offers such an option (it's normally off by default).


Installing :mod:`simple_tide_report`
====================================

The simplest way to install :mod:`simple_tide_report` is to simply copy the directory structure to a location on your home directory. :mod:`simple_tide_report` can then be run from within this directory in the standard way.
