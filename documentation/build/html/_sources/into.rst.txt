Introduction
============

This script forms part of the Threat Intelligence toolkit to attempt to
simplify running a PoC for Threat Intelligence and demonstrating the value
of TIDE and our threat intel offerings.

The simple_tide_report.py script is designed to read a list of hostnames, URLs
or IP address from a file and generate a simplified CSV report from TIDE data.

The script can look at both the 'Active State' and complete TIDE data, in
addition to having the ability to use a local sqlite database containing
local TIDE data generated [#]
