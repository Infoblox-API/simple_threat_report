Installing Python
=================

You can install the latest version of Python 3.x by downloading the appropriate installer for your system from `python.org <https://python.org>`_.

.. note::

  Older versions of MacOS come with Python 2.x by default so you will need to install Python 3 as above or if via Homebrew, Ports, etc.

.. note::

  If you are installing Python on Windows, be sure to check the box to have Python added to your PATH if the installer offers such an option (it's normally off by default).


Installing :mod:`simple_threat_report`

The simplest way to install and maintain the tools is to clone this 
repository::

    % git clone https://github.com/Infoblox-API/simple_threat_report

Alternative you can download as a Zip file from github.


Installing :mod:`bloxone` module
